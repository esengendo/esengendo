### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Emmanuel and I'm a University of Michigan trained Data Scientist interested in all things Machine Learning and Python!  I live in the beautiful San Francisco Bay Area, California USA.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing a "Customer Help Tool Chatbot" that leverages a latest open-source LLM model.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the Langchain framework.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on all data science Projects, especially those in the NLP.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: esengendo@gmail.com
  
#### Technical Skills: Python, SQL, AWS, LangChain

### Education

B.S., Business Administration - Information Technology | California State University - East Bay

### Projects

#### End-To-End Text-To-SQL Querying Application

I built this IntelliQuery, an end-to-end Text-to-SQL conversion and database querying application that leverages LLMs in data extraction. The application integrates Google Palm and LangChain with a MySQL database (Threadz E-Store), and leverages Streamlit for an advanced yet intuitive user interface. By harnessing the power of Few Shot Prompting, the application optimizes SQL database querying, significantly enhancing the user experience and operational efficiency. The Streamlit-integrated Text-to-SQL tool within IntelliQuery not only simplifies complex database interactions but also augments data insights, streamlining the entire process of data management and setting a new benchmark for efficiency in the field.

#### Multi-PDF Document Query and Response Application

I built a PDF Conversational Interface Application that harnesses the power of LangChain, OpenAI, and Streamlit, providing users with the ability to upload, process, and interact with PDF documents in a conversational manner. This tool aims to offer an intuitive, responsive, and seamless experience for extracting and querying document information, thereby enhancing knowledge accessibility and user engagement.

#### IT Helpdesk Ticket Time Predction Analysis

I designed this project to center on constructing a machine learning model to forecast the resolution times for IT helpdesk tickets. Advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as text summarization and sentiment analysis are employed to distill salient features from ticket narratives, enhancing the model's predictive capability. Analyzing historical ticket data from a Kaggle's IT Helpdesk Dataset, the project aims to bolster customer satisfaction and improve operational workflows and resource deployment within IT helpdesk services, showcasing the synergy of data science and NLP in refining support mechanisms.

#### San Francisco Business Closure Analysis Project

- Engineered a predictive model with machine learning algorithms to forecast San Francisco business closures using historical datasets, targeting key economic and demographic predictors.
  
- Leveraged data science methodologies, including geospatial analytics and clustering, to map and interpret business viability across San Francisco, providing data-driven recommendations for economic strategy and policy development.
